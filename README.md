## Development Workflow

### Loan Processing Flow

1. Borrower submits loan application with required information
2. AI models analyze borrower data and determine creditworthiness
3. Smart contracts create loan terms based on AI assessment
4. Lenders review and fund loans that match their criteria
5. Smart contracts manage loan disbursement and repayment
6. AI models continuously learn from loan performance data

### AI Model Development

- Classification models for borrower default prediction
- Regression models to calculate appropriate interest rates
- Clustering models for borrower segmentation
- Time series models for market trend analysis and liquidity forecasting

### 1. Smart Contract Development

- Write Solidity contracts to:
  - Manage loan creation, disbursement, and repayment
  - Handle disputes and penalties for default
  - Implement governance and protocol upgrades
  - Ensure security and gas optimization

### 2. AI Model Development

- Train AI models on financial and behavioral datasets
- Use supervised learning to predict borrower risks
- Implement reinforcement learning for dynamic interest rate adjustment
- Deploy models as API endpoints for integration with the platform

### 3. Backend Development

- Build API endpoints for interacting with smart contracts and AI models
- Securely handle off-chain borrower data
- Implement event listeners for blockchain transactions
- Create services for user management, notifications, and analytics

### 4. Frontend Development

- Develop loan application forms and dashboards for lenders and borrowers
- Create interactive visualizations for loan performance
- Implement Web3 connectivity for blockchain interactions
- Build responsive interfaces for both web and mobile platforms
